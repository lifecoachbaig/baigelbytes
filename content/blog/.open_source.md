## Introduction, what is open source?

Open source, it's not just the future, it's the here and now! Open source software currently runs on 100% of the worlds supercomputers and basically runs the entire internet. Even microsofts cloud platform Azure runs on GNU/Linux an open source operating system.

Think about that, Microsoft, a company that is known for propriatary software like Windows and Microsoft Office, uses linux in it's cloud.

But what is open source you might be wondering. Well let me ask you a few things...


* Do you believe in freedom?

* Do you believe in having ownership of your possessions and data rather than letting corporations own it instead?

* Would you love to be able to use and configure your computers and software however you like without restriction?

<br>

If you answered yes to any or all of those questions then you might be interested in open source software. The term 'Open Source' reffers to the public availability of a software packages source code or the code that the program is written in. Allowing anyone to freely access a programs source code means that you, me or anyone else could - if we know the language or are willing to learn it - verify that the software is actually doing what the publisher says it is.

Apple for example like to tell people that they don't share any of your data but as the operating system and all of its software is proprietry or closed source there's really no way of leagally checking to see if they are keeping their word. Microsoft by and large operate the same way although in recent years they do appear to be embracing[^1] open source more.

With open source software like firefox for example, if they were to make a claim like "We don't share any data without your explicit permission.", you could dive into the source code and check for yourself if this is the case or not.

Also, this means that there are more often than not, far more people maintaining a large open source project than the number of people maintaining a closed source project which is always good for security because the more eyes you have on the code the less time it will take for someone to spot and deal with bugs and/or viruses or malware.

Open source software then, by it's very nature is more secure, adaptible and robust than propriatary software.

## I want a go!!

Well, it's highly likely that you're already using open source software in some capacity without even realising it. Open source projects include anything running android, most things that have the word 'smart' in their titles (smart watches, smart fridges etc), Teslas, TV's, most epos systems (the computers at tills in stores).

Even Microsoft has it's own open source projects on the go now like Windows Terminal, which is a teminal emulator that lets you use command prompt, powershell and WSL in one place, WSL being Windows Subsystem for Linux, because yes, you can run linux as an app inside of windows!

Incase you're wondering what a terminal emulator is, it's a program that lets you use and control computers using words that you type into a screen instead of pointing and clicking on things with your mouse. It's actually how computers were normally used back in ye olden times and was known as a CLI or command line interface.

Why do people still use them then? Because for a lot of tasks, typing commands into a terminal can greatly increase effiency and productivity!

If all of this sounds like something you would like to dip your toes into then great! But...


## Freedom and responsibility go hand in hand.

While there are lots of open source programs you can start using right away like Firefox as an alternative to Chrome or Libre Office in place of Microsoft Office, when it comes to really diving into open source like switiching to GNU/Linux for example there will be a learning curve and you should be ready to spend time googling (or ducking[^2]) any issues that you come accross as the mantality is much more mature with open source in the sense that people will not hold your hands and do everything for you.

Part of the responsibility of having as system that you can configure to your liking is that you will be the one doing the configuring not some giant profit addicted corporation. An analogy to this could be the difference between staying in a hotel or owning your own house.

In a hotel you still do the same basic things like sleep, eat, shower etc but all of the elements of the hotel itself are outside of your control. You cannot decide on the coulour of the curtains or the wallpaper, the corporation does. You cannot decide on what TV you want or whether to get a different bed, that's all decided by the corporation. If you don't like it you're free to leave the hotel although this is where the analogy comes to a very swift end!

Corporations are incentivised to get you adicted to and dependent on, their products and no one does this more than Apple. Apple basically are a technological cult, who's fans aren't just addicted and dependent, but blindly faithful in anything Apple does.

If Apple realeased a chocolate teapot, most of it's fans (after camping outside apple stores days in advance to buy one) would argue that it's the best teapot the world has ever known and that the fact that it can't hold anything other than cold beverages on days when the weather is not too hot is actually what makes is the best teapot in the complete history of teapots!

Now, back to that analogy... In your own house you can basically do whatever the heck you want so long as it doesen't affect anyone eles lives.

You want to hang a TV on the wall? You hang a TV on the wall. You want to buy all new furnatire in every room? You buy new furnature for every room. You want to renovate the kitchen and bathroom? I think you get my point, and this is how it is in the world of open source.

Whatever you want to do with the software, go ahead but you will be the one doing it. It's not that you can't get help, there are plenty of forums, websites, videos, books and other resources online that you can use to teach yourself anything you like about linux as well as resolve any issue, so long as you're willing to put in the time and effort to learn. Just like with your own home DIY projects!

Open source really is best for people who value freedom and don't mind taking time to learn new things, just as you would- if you wanted to do it yourself - have to learn how to measure the dimentions of your kitchen and bathroom so you know exactly what you can and can't do with them, for example.

If you want to try out some free open source software without risking breaking your pc I've listed some programs below that you can try out right now.


### Office Applications:

**Libre Office**

An alternative to microsoft office. It's open source and doesn't cost you a penny unless you decide to donate to the project via their website.

Their main website: 

https://www.libreoffice.org/

Some tutorials on how to install Libre Office on your computer:

Macs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJw9c4oCwQ

PC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RLwUwoAKNY

**Zoho Office**

This is a purley web based office suite which means you will not actually have to download or install anything on your device. Zoho offers open source alternatives to almost all the google apps like mail, calendar, docs (word), sheets (excel), slides etc.

To try out Zoho office use the following link and click 'Get Started' in the top right corner. Make sure you click the personal account option though too avoid any charges:

https://www.zoho.com/docs/office-suite.html

### Web Browsers:

**Firefox**

Firefox is a great open source web browser, it's actually my favorite to be honest. You can download it from their website:

https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/

**Brave**

If you want to use an open source web browser but you like the look and feel of Chrome then Brave is the one for you. It's based on the Chromium browser which is what Google Chrome is based on but Brave have modified it to make sure that you are not being spied on by add agencies and secret agents.

Use the following link to install it:

https://brave.com/


### Email:

**Zoho Mail**

I think these days, most people tend not to use offline mail apps opting instead for things like gmail which run entirely online. Zoho mail is one of the services you are automatically provided with when you creat a zoho account. If you haven't already signed up after reading about Zoho Office then feel free to use the link below to do just that.

Make sure you click the personal account option though too avoid any charges.

https://www.zoho.com/mail/

**Thunderbird**

From the creators of Firefox, an open source email program as awesome as the TV show from your childhood. If you're one of those people who like yo use desktop email apps like outlook then this is the open source alternative for you. Now you'll be able to access your new zoho mailbox without launching a web browser. It has its advantages.

Use the link below to download and install thunderbird:

https://www.thunderbird.net/en-GB/


Hopefully, this should be enough to get you started.

As I'm a GNU/Linux user myself, I will be doing some articles on that too incase you were interested in trying out open source operating systems. If you can't wait till then, I would reccomend you look into either Pop OS, or Arco Linux as they are more begginer friendly.

**To start off with, definitely install these on virtual machines though and not on your actual computers as making mistakes there could wreck your machines and cause you to lose any data you had on them.**
