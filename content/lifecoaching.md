## What can life coaching do for you?

Life coaching is life changing, plain and simple! Right from the outset you will gain clarity on what your goals and dreams are (If you're not already clear about them that is.) and what you can do right now to start achieving them.

Then together, we will create a unique plan to ensure you keep making consistent progress towards your goals whilst removing any blocks you might encounter along the way.

Consistency is absolutely key to transforming your life and that's exactly what I will help you with as in addition to the sessions I will also hold you accountable to any goals or action steps that are set.

You'll start to see progress from the very first session and where you go from there is completely up to you!

There are several different options listed below feel free to pick whichever one best suits your needs. Please mention the service you're interested in using in the booking email.

**Please note: ALL payments must be made in advance of recieving any services.**

### One, 1 Hour Coaching Session
1 hour · £50

In a typical 1st session, we would look at where you are now, what challenges you're facing in general and what goals or aspirations you might have. Then we co-create a plan unique to you that you can use to achieve those goals.
One off sessions can be booked as often or as seldom as needed and can benefit people who are just curious about Life Coaching and want to experience some of it's benefits. Each session also comes with 1 week of messaging support.
For maximum benefit though it is recomended to have a session once a week as this will help you progress consistently towards your goals.

### One Months Life Coaching (5 Sessions)
1 hour per session · £200

With a month long subscription you will get 5 hour long life coaching sessions and 5 weeks of messaging support. Getting continued support ensures that any momentum that is built up in sessions is maintained over time to ensure you're always moving towards your goals and dreams!

This is for the people who are ready to change their lives and to put in the consistent energy to make their dreams a reality.

If you are unsure if this is for you, I would recomend booking a one off session first.

### One, 30 Minute Coaching Session
£30

These shorter 30 minute sessions are for people who just want a quick taste of what working with a life coach is like. They follow a condensed version of the 1 hour format so we still get to see where you are now and what goals and aspirations you have, but not as in depth as we could with a full hour session.
30 Minute sessions don't come with any additional support as they are really just taster sessions.

### One Week of messaging support.
£30

If you would just like messaging support without live sessions this is the option for you. We won't be able to go as in depth as we would with a full, hour long session but we can still explore your goals and make some plans on how they can be achieved.
Messaging is done via facebook, whatsapp or email.

### Five Weeks Messaging Support
£100

If you would just like messaging support without live sessions this is the option for you. We won't be able to go as in depth as we would with a full, hour long session but we can still explore your goals and make some plans on how they can be achieved.
Messaging is done via facebook, whatsapp or email.

## Life Coaching helps you...

### To see and know yourself.

Life Coaching helps you to look at yourself and your life without filters or opinions from other people or even your own prejudices. It helps you to identify your strengths as well as areas you could work on (and we all have those) and then plan how to move forward but as I mentioned before; it's not about me telling you what to do or how to live your life. With life coaching, YOU are in control of your progression!

### To believe in yourself.

You can be the fittest person on earth, but if you don't believe in yourself that won't matter when the going gets tough. How we see ourselves is EVERYTHING! With life coaching a big part of my job is to get you to believe not just in who you are now, but who you WILL be tomorrow! With an iron clad mind, your dreams will have no choice but to tremble and quiver in fear before giving in to your sheer relentless progression!!

### To envision and then create your BEST self!

If everyone on earth since the dawn of our species had the power to fly, would we still call it a superpower? No, It'd be as normal as walking!

### Vision IS our superpower!

At some point in history, someone invented the first spear. Something that had never existed before, something no one else had even imagined let alone thought impossible! Look at us now! There's a lot we need to improve on as a species but boy have we progressed!! Vision, isn't our only superpower, but if you ask me, it might just be our greatest.

Coaching teaches you not just the power of vision, but how to implement it as well as holding you accountable for taking the steps you create towards your goals, dreams and aspirations. 

Don't live everyday like it's your last, live everyday like it's your FIRST! You have EVERYTHING to gain! All the lessons from the days, weeks, months, years and decades since you were born. Every decision you've made in life has brought you to where you are now, and every decision you make from now on will determine where you go from here!
