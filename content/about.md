I used to be an IT guy, I left the industry in search of something different. I go through phases where I'm into different topics and subjects so the subjects and topics I make posts about on here will change over time and not be devoted to just one single area of interest.

I'm an aspie, I believe the pc term is now, 'high functioning autism' though I'm not much of a fan of that description as it might lead some people to think that I might be some kind of genius when really, I'm just your avarage Adnan :).

On this blog site I will cover topics such as self help, self improvment or skill/habit building, religion and science, lgbtqia+ related topics and more. To keep up to date with new posts follow me on social media using the links on the homepage or the information below:
